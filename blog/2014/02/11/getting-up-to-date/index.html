<h4>Here is an quick update to my current situation.</h4>

<p>Last year I decided on going to Dev Bootcamp. The application was started on <strong>June 27th 2013</strong> and submitted about a month later. I spent a week planning and making my instructional application video which can be found here. The video is embarrassing in hindsight, but I get truly nervous when I want something intensely.</p>

<p>After I was notified about being picked for an interview on <strong>August 9th 2013</strong> I got an interview date for a Skype call with Tiffany Mikell at the Chicago DBC for <strong>August 28th 2013</strong>. The interview went smoothly and a lot of it seemed like chit-chat but I think my personality was being gauged as well as my technical skill. (DBC gave some prep work to be done before the interview.)
The highlight of the interview was a brain teaser which in and of itself is not important. The important part was the process you used to break down the problem and work through it. Your personal problem solving algorithm if you will. The last bit of the interview was walking through simple ruby code and explaining what each line meant as we went. It was silly easy, but really I think it was to check that you can process code and explain code at all.</p>

<p>Then a nervous three days passed before they sent me a Congratulations E-Mail on my acceptance. (September 1st 2013 Yay!)</p>

<p><strong>October 5th 2013</strong>: the Phase 0 and prep work was sent out.</p>

<p><strong>November 3rd 2013</strong>: I noticed an update on the DBC website announcing the opening of a DBC location in NYC so I quickly sent Tanner Welsh an E-mail  asking how I would be able to switch from the Chicago location to the NYC location. He had me sign up for an interview to get in touch with him. I assumed it would be a similar interview to the first one questioning technical knowledge and what not but it was nearly the opposite.
The interview was backwards. Tanner had me interview him to make sure I really wanted to come to the NYC location. It was pretty awesome and the next day I confirmed everything and got a slot in the <strong>March 31st 2014</strong> Cohort.</p>

<p>After checking off most of the prep work that I needed to do and fast forwarding a bit I get an E-Mail from Tanner letting everyone know that Phase 0 starts on <strong>January 4th</strong> and giving all of the details about the work load we will have an the coding we will be doing.</p>

<h4>FIDDLER CRABS - The name of our NYC Cohort.</h4>

<p>I was super eager, but saw the email while a work. That night I hopped on my computer and dived in head-first completing assignments and then checking the solutions of other students after I finished to reinforce the information as well as pick up new tricks.</p>

<p>Fast forward four weeks and my job let me know that I will be laid off. This was a mixed blessing because I was going to be leaving for school in a couple months, but it hurt that I wouldn’t be able to see my co-workers as frequently. They’re good people.</p>

<p>Present day <strong>February 11th 2014</strong>: It has almost been a year since I first decided to go to DBC. Throughout that time I have realized this has been the best work life decision I have ever made.</p>

<p>I have learned an insane amount about coding in the past 5 weeks and the real work hasn’t even started yet!</p>

<p>Each day I update here I will also add a work of art I have made.</p>
